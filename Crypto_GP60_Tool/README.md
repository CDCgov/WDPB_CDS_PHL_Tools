# Cryptosporidium GP60 Characterization Tool


### Tool Functionality

This tool's intended purpose is to perform Cryptosporidium subtyping utuilizing the GP60 genomic target region within the Cryptosporidum genome. The region targets the subtype family, short tandem repeats and secondary repeats within the sequece. The tool works with Sanger sequences and isolate whole genome contig sequences in fasta format.
